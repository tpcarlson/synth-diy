# Oak - Kit BOM

##### Customisation

Should you wish to customise your Oak:

- The jacks used are Thonkiconn jacks and will accept alternative nuts

- The mode button can be swapped for other colours of D6RXX F1 LFS switch

- The round lock LED buttons (LP4OA1PBCTG) may be swapped for other LED colours, although anything other than green tends to be hard to find

- Instead of keyed JST-XH headers and cables, a 3x 2.54mm pair of headers and cables may be used instead

- The 2-pin 2.54mm header and tactile button can be ommitted, but they are very useful to put Oak's RP2040 into recovery mode if a firmware flash goes wrong
