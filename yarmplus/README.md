# YARM+

##### What is this?

An implementation of the [YARM+](https://www.schmitzbits.de/vca.html) ring modulator by René Schmitz.

##### How much power does it use?

As measured by the joranalogue Test 3, around 15mA on +12v and 10mA on -12v at peak. The 5v rail is unused.

##### Where does the design come from?

From the [VCA](https://www.schmitzbits.de/vca.html) pages of René Schmitz.

##### Are there any rare/weird parts used?

You'll need to find an MC1496P chip to build this, unfortunately they're a little difficult to track down. I got mine from Aliexpress and the chips that arrived appeared to be recycled from dead electronics. I'd usually try and buy new chips from proper retailers where possible...

##### Are there any problems with the design?

Nope, works nicely! If I were to add anything, perhaps indicator LEDs for the two inputs and the output - but I'm an LED junkie, and it's definitely not necessary.

##### Do you have a BOM/Mouser cart/Tayda links?

Sorry, no. Things go out of stock so frequently it'd be a lot of work to keep these up to date. Everything in this project is easy to source though (Other than the MC1496P), so you should not have any trouble.

##### Can I buy PCBs or a kit?

Send me an email (twigathy+synth@gmail.com)...
