# Oneshot - Kit BOM

This is the bill of materials for the Oneshot module's Kit. For full kits the SMT parts will already be soldered and are omitted.

Elements marked 1U or 3U are only used for those varients of the module.

##### Customisation

Should you wish to customise your Oneshot module:

- The jacks used are Thonkiconn jacks and will accept alternative nuts. Spacing may be a little tight on the 1U version.

- For the 1U module, the D6R90F1LFS may be swapped for other colours.

- For the 3U module, the arcade button should be swappable for any other screw or panel mount, 30mm button. The clearance is a little tight, and very deep buttons might limit which case you can mount the module into.

- Knobs for the potentiometers can be swapped for another D-shaft knob.

- If you want to avoid soldering wires to the button, many arcade buttons also have spade connectors which could be used. Adafruit sells quick-connect JST to crimped quick-connect cables which might work for you.
