# Oneshot

##### What is this?

Oneshot is a kind of envelope generator, with a built-in mixer for adding other CV signals to the output or for chaining together Oneshot modules. 

Oneshot's brains are on one PCB, with the front PCB offering options for 1U and 3U. The 3U design is my favourite, with a large arcade button and good knob spacing. The 1U design files are also included, if you wish to try them out too.

##### How much power does it use?

As measured by the joranalogue Test 3, at the very most 40 mA on +12v and 20mA on -12v. The 5v rail is unused. When idle, around 20mA.

##### Where does the design come from?

This one's a bit of a mongrel of different designs, with some sections from the ElectricDruid datasheet and others from previous projects.

##### Are there any rare/weird parts used?

Oneshot's parts should be easy and inexpensive to source. The one exception to this is the Oneshot IC itself which can be bought from ElectricDruid's website ([ONESHOT Event Generator](https://electricdruid.net/product/oneshot-event-generator/)).

Oneshot's arcade button is a 30mm snap-in part.

##### Are there any problems with the design?

Prototype 2 PCBs have the JST-XH header silkscreen for the button on the wrong side of the PCB.

##### Do you have a BOM/Mouser cart/Tayda links?

Sorry, no. Things go out of stock so frequently it'd be a lot of work to keep these up to date. Everything in this project is easy to source though, so you should not have any trouble.

##### Can I buy PCBs or a kit?

(TBC - links go to Oak)

Available as a [DIY Kit from Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/divergentwaves/oak/), or as a [built module from Reverb](https://reverb.com/uk/item/85429774-divergent-waves-oak).

(TBC - add a photo of a build 1U/3U module)
